# WindowFlow
*Effortlessly restore and organize your workspace with our customizable app launcher.*

I often have multiple projects running simultaneously and it always frustrated me that I couldn't easily restore my workspace. By workspace, I mean a set of windows that are opened and positioned appropriately. For example, one workspace may consist of Firefox with three tabs maximized on one screen, two file explorers side by side on the other screen, and Unreal Engine on top of it.

Inspired by Curtis Holt's recent video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDawvvcx1dE), I began searching for a solution to this problem. However, it seemed that there were none available for Windows or they were quite expensive for such a simple functionality. After discussing with Mathew in Curtis's Discord community, we decided to create our own solution.

Here it is - the first version, which has relatively simple functionality. It launches all the apps based on a manually written config file and places them in set positions. More updates will come in the future."

# Roadmap
